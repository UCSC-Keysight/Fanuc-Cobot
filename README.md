# Fanuc-Cobot

### Overview
- This temporary repository contains a prototype OpenTAP plugin for Fanuc's CRX-20iA/L collaborative robot.
- The prototype demonstrates how teams can leverage OpenTAP's automation capabilities to streamline repetitive and minor tasks associated with test and measurement.
- This plugin was developed using Fanuc's ROBOGUIDE simulator as a proof of concept. While the design should be applicable to a physical robot, additional field testing will likely be necessary.

### Demo
Moving the CRX-20iA/L programatically with OpenTAP.
